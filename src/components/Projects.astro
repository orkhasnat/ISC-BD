const treeH = `Rainfall has decreased significantly in the northwestern part of the country in recent years. Also rainfall patterns variation and delayed monsoon season is also one of the causes of drought in the region. Low rainfall results in groundwater depletion, the level is declining, which is making the situation worse and the suffering of people's livelihood more intense. In this case it is important to develop some adaptation technologies involving limited use of underground water. Planting trees along land, roadsides, ponds and water bodies can reduce the impact of drought. To this purpose looking ahead, ISC planted 2000 saplings in Huzurapur village of Goala union of Sapahar upazila of Naogaon district.
500 trees also have been planted around polo ground of tigerpass, Chattogram.`;

Karam is a significant festival for plain land indigenous communities, where it is celebrated with great enthusiasm. The festival is an opportunity for the ethnic to come together and celebrate their culture and traditions. It is also a time to thank the gods for a bountiful harvest and to pray for prosperity and good health.

On the day of Karam, people go to the forest to collect branches of the Karam tree. These branches are then decorated with flowers and fruits and planted in a central location. People gather around the Karam tree to sing, dance, and pray. They also offer food and drink to the deity. This historic festival has been sponsored by ISC since 2020.

const text = `In contrast to the mainstream Bengali population, small ethnographic minority communities in the plains are generally live in isolated and remote areas that lack modern civil opportunities. Children of ethnic minorities are also denied access to modern education and training, among many other deprivations. Poverty, different social and cultural structures, different languages, and geographical distance affect the children of these communities.The main reason is lack of access to modern education and school facilities. A total of 160 children were deprived of education in Mathurapur village under Patnitala upazila of Naogaon district. A primary school has been built on 30 percent of Khas land by ISC, funded by Asha Hoffnung fur Bangladesh e.V. The name of the school is Mathurapur Syed Jamil Hasan Anandamayi Primary School.`;
